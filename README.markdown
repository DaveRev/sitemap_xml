## Installation

1. Upload the 'sitemap_xml' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Publish Filtering", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. Select Blueprints > Sitemap XML to view the sitemap XML

## Configuration
The site map needs to know which page is your index/home page, and which are the global pages to be included. 
By default it assumes the index/home page will have the type "index" and global pages have the type "map". 
If you use a different convention in your Page Type field then you can change these in the System > Preferences page. 
You can also specify the modification date and change frequency in the System > Preferences page. These are set to the current date/time at installation and "monthly" respectively.
